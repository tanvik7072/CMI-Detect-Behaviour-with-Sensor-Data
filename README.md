# CMI-Detect Behaviour with Sensor Data

This GitHub repository is part of our submission to the CMI-Detect: Behavior with Sensor Data competition hosted on Kaggle.

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can detect Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRBs) using data collected from a wrist-worn device (Helios). BFRBs include behaviors such as nail-biting and hair-pulling. The challenge is to accurately distinguish these gestures from non-BFRB activities using signals from the various sensors on the Helios device.

Note: Due to licensing restrictions, we cannot share the dataset in this repository. To access the data, please visit the competition page on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cmi-detect-behavior-with-sensor-data/overview).
